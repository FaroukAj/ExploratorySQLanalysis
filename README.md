The 'Customer Sales' SQL project is an analysis of a customer sales dataset that aims to provide insights into customer buying patterns and preferences. The project involves querying a database of sales transactions and customer information using SQL queries to perform tasks such as calculating revenue generated by payment method, identifying top customers by revenue generated, analyzing age and gender demographics of customers, determining popular product categories by age group, and finding average revenue generated per day by shopping mall.
